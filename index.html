            <p>  Within the Asia-Pacific region, the tendency has been to grant local communities the responsibility for protecting forest resources, without granting the rights to use them in a major way.
             <br>Where local use is permitted, it is usually highly circumscribed and generally limited to minor or non-wood forest products. 
                For example, a tribal community in the Philippines was given the responsibility to protect a watershed, but no rights to use the resources within it. 
                Ancestral domain legislation in the Philippines is intended to recognize traditional connections to resources as a basis for formal tenure, but in this case formal tenure has brought responsibilities without rights (see Datu Ontog Lolong1). 
                Another clear example is the case of protected areas in India (see Badola), where people are given the responsibility to protect resources but are not given access to use them. 
                A related problem is the decentralization of responsibility without devolution of the power to make independent decisions or to take action outside narrow parameters set by forest authorities. 
            <br>Key forest management objectives are usually set by governments, and the decision-making authority of local communities tends to be limited to decisions that meet these objectives. 
                The pattern of devolving responsibility without power is also evident in the decentralization policies of the Philippines where local government units are the main local implementers. 
                Local government units are given the responsibility to implement programs without the opportunity to define the programs - nor are they allocated adequate resources to meet the new responsibilities. 
                In real devolution, those to whom responsibilities are devolved should have substantive input in setting the objectives, rather than simply meeting objectives set by others. 
               "Substantive input" does not necessarily mean that all decision making is devolved, but it does imply the genuine possibility of affecting outcomes, and a willingness on the part of those devolving authority to modify their objectives. 
             <br> This discussion raises some serious questions about devolution. 
                Why, given all the official policies and rhetoric concerned with decentralization and devolution, are governments and forest authorities apparently willing to devolve only responsibility? Are they trying to maintain control over valuable resources while cutting management costs? Or do forest authorities simply not trust communities to make the right decisions? 
                To what extent are forest management objectives negotiable? To what extent should they be negotiable? 
                There is much disagreement as to whether forest resources should be handed over to communities at all. 
                One line of thinking holds that devolution to communities is not only desirable, but necessary; another holds that it is totally undesirable. 
             <br> Between these extremes lie other less absolute viewpoints. 
                The main argument in favor of devolution is essentially pragmatic: conventional forest management (i.e. through forest departments) has not worked well in much of the region (see Banerjee). 
                Continuing high deforestation rates have been viewed as evidence that the current system is not working. 
                Devolution is expected to offer more effective management. 
                In addition, it is often argued that devolution is desirable on grounds of equity, integrity, equal development and social justice.
